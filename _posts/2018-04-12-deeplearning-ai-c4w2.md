**Introduction**

The Link Lab is on the leading edge of collaborative workspaces in academic research, with the goal of improving the fields of Smart Health, Smart Cities and Autonomous Systems. As such the Link Lab has engaged in a monumental study, aimed to further current research on the ways Smart Buildings can learn from and respond to its users, creating a more comfortable and productive environment.

This is a new frontier for research, and as such it&#39;s important to review, and study policies and guidelines to ensure that they comply with the principles of ethical and informed research. This report aims to examine the Living Link Lab (LLL) study and the ways in which it does or does not meet the criteria for complying with best practice ethics [3].

**Executive Summary**

1. _Purpose_

Research is important, and the necessity of it is clear. However, historically research has not always been conducted in an ethical or humane manner. As responsible engineering researchers it is our responsibility to ensure that any research we take part in adheres to ethical best practices for autonomous systems and human research. This report aims to be a thorough analysis and critique of current study framework; additionally this report will provide suggested ethical guidelines and framework to bring the LLL Research further in-line with the guiding principles of Ethically Aligned Design and ethical human research [3].

1. _General Principles_

The Ethically Aligned Design (EAD) report was developed out of a need for a framework of  principles that any researcher working with A/IS systems should adhere to [1]. It emphasises the need for transparency and clarity at all times for A/IS systems, and has built in considerations for users and non-users of the technology [1]. Similarly, the Belmont Report (BR) was created in 1978 to create an ethical framework of best practice principles for human research [2]. Similar to the EAD, the BR emphasizes the need for human autonomy, including informed consent and the principle of beneficence. The LLL study, as it is designed, falls under the aegis of both sets of ethical guidelines, involving both human research and autonomous systems [3]. This necessitates finding a way to align the study&#39;s implementation with both ethical frameworks.

Table 1a. The principles of EAD and BR [1],[2]

**Ethical Analysis**

I.Consent

As mentioned in the BR[1] Informed consent is an essential part of human research. However, this principle appears to have been missed in the design of the LLL project [3]. While the proposal does state that the research would be IRB compliant, it does not detail how the researchers intend to do so [3]. In fact, currently there are no notifications or signs on any of the entrances to Link Lab alerting people to the fact that data are being gathered inside the building utilizing visible sensors. The lack of notice on the entrances means that individuals are not given the ability to make an informed decision about having their data collected.

Another part of informed consent in both the EAD and BR is the right to decline participation [1], [2]. Currently there does not appear to be any plans in place for individuals who do not want their data collected while visiting the Link Lab [3]. This means that individuals would be barred from entering the Link Lab because they did not want to participate in the LLL study. This is in direct contrast to the principles of the EAD and BR, both of which place a high emphasis on respecting human autonomy and not penalizing non-users who in this situation are those who choose not to participate [1], [2].

The LLL proposal also mentions the use of wearable technology and Sensus to assess anxiety and depression [3]. Given that there are individuals in the Link Lab with anxiety and/or depression that kind of data collection could be very uncomfortable, and the results potentially stigmatizing. It is understandable that these individuals might wish to opt out of that part of the study, while still participating in the other sections of the study. However, the LLL proposal

lacks any framework to protect that non-user population. Additionally there is no mention in the proposal on handling participants who may be comfortable consenting to some parts of the study, but not others. Both the EAD and the BR include principles of ensuring the wellbeing of humans, which in this case includes both users and non-users [1], [2].

Additionally the study design does not include plans for how to handle people who can&#39;t, by definition, consent to having their information recorded and used in a study [3]. This group generally includes anyone under the age of 18, and anyone over the age of 18 who is legally unable to enter into contracts.



II. Transparency

In addition to consent, transparency is also a core part of ethical human research, specifically transparency regarding what data is being collected, where it is being collected, and what is being done with the data. In the EAD this is the Data Agency principle, which states that all A/IS creators must ensure that individuals can access and securely share their data, allowing individuals to maintain control over their information. In the BR this concept is covered under the Respect for Persons and Informed Consent principles, which combined state that participants must be able to make informed decisions about whether they want to participant initially, and that they continuously be able to make informed decisions about what activities they want to participate in and why. Additionally individuals are who are unaware that data was collected are unable to request their data be deleted.

Additionally, participants should be able to know which rooms are collecting what types of data, and how the data was being utilized. For example, cameras are mentioned in the LLL proposal, can participants assume the bathrooms will not have cameras [3]? Some of this information is available in the proposal but that proposal is not accessible to participants [3]. The proposal itself does not have a plan detailing how that information will be made available [3].

1. _Wellbeing of Inhabitants_

Both the EAD and the BR include principles of ensuring the wellbeing of humans, both users and non-users [1],[2]. In line with these principles, the LLL proposal references having inobtrusive mechanisms for gathering data, such as sensors and cameras [3]. The researchers also emphasized the many of these devices would require no interaction from the participant, such as the would be no-touch sensors [3]. Additionally the proposal also mentioned data would be measured using Humanyze badges, which are designed to not record sensitive data and to deidentify the data [3].

Another important consideration in the wellbeing of occupants is how to handle users vs non-users. As mentioned previously the LLL proposal does not have a way for people to opt out of part, or all, of the study short of refusing to enter the building [3]. In other words, the LLL study violates the autonomy of the occupants of the lab, a significant negative impact on their mental health. Individuals outside of the lab will likely face criticism and stigma if they refuse to enter the Link Lab.

As previously mentioned part of the LLL study involves the use of sensing badges, asset tags, and wrist-worn watches to gather data with the goal of helping improve occupants mental state [3]. However, that same data can be used to identify mental illness, for example there is evidence supporting the use of heart rate variability as diagnostic markers for Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder [4]. The LLL is unclear on whether the HRV data will also be deidentified, which creates a risk that a participant will be identified as having a mental illness without their consent [3].

Assuming that occupants of the Link Lab are able to opt out of [part of] the study, what considerations have researchers take to reduce stigma against non-users? For example the badges and wrist watches are clearly visible indicators of participation, so people without them are easily identified as non-participants. The LLL proposal does include a plan for handling stigma against non-users, which is counter to the EAD principle of Well-being and the BR principle of Beneficence [1], [2].

Another consideration in line with the principles of well-being and beneficence is the impact that always being monitored will have on the occupants of the Link Lab. Nothing in the proposal indicates any framework or considerations put in place to detect potential negative impacts caused by the monitoring, or to mitigate any resulting harm to participants [3]. This would be a requirement for the LLL to be aligned with the ethical principles of the EAD and BR [1], [2].

A final consideration is the effect of autonomous robots on inhabitants of the lab. Currently there are people in the Link Lab who need to utilize canes or crutches, what steps are being taken to safeguard the AI/S so they do not cause a collision, or to prevent them from knocking someone&#39;s cane or crutch over? Consideration for individuals with disabilities is a key part of the BR&#39;s Respect for Person principle; There does not appear to be any framework for impact on individuals with disabilities in the LLL proposal [3].



1. Competence and Accountability

Research requires many abilities, including the ability to recognize and account for potential bias factors. The Link Lab is a multicultural environment, with people from a multitude of countries and cultural backgrounds. Additionally there are also people of different races, religions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ages, and individuals with disabilities.  In such a diverse environment, how will the data be collected and processed in a way that will correctly account for differences caused by various factors, while still remaining deidentified? The LLL proposal doesn&#39;t have any guidelines for how they will account for cultural differences in facial expressions, or tone/cadence of vocalizations [3]. As mentioned in a previous section, HRV can differ significantly due to some mental illnesses, how will that kind of information be accounted for so it doesn&#39;t falsely skew the data? These questions are in line with two principles of the EAD, Accountability and Competence. In the EAD framework to be &#39;accountable&#39; A/IS systems are required to provide rationale for their decisions at all times; the principle of Competence states that A/IS shall adhere to the knowledge and skill required for safe operation. To better adhere to those principles, the LLL needs to have framework that will catch potential sources of unwanted variance (ie HRV differences due to medical, not environment), that way they can be excluded from the data for that particular factor.

1. Security

Security is paramount in research, and doubly so when you are working with human subjects. The LLL proposal mentions that one of the Co-PIs is working on creating new security technologies for protecting user privacy, which is perfectly aligned with the EAD principles of Competence, Data Agency and Awareness of Misuse [1],[3]. Additionally, as mentioned in the proposal, the Link Lab is a limited access facility, so it has a higher hardware security than many other workspaces would. There do not appear to be any issues with the security level measures outlined by the LLL proposal.



**Summary**

The Link Lab has done many amazing things so far, and will continue to do them in the future. However significant work needs to be done to bring the Living Link Lab (LLL) study, and to some extent the Link Lab as a whole, into alignment with the principles of the Ethically Aligned Design (EAD) and the Belmont Report (BR). This report focused on the EAD principles of Human Rights, Well-being, Data Agency, Accountability, Awareness of Misuse and Competence. The BR report focused on the principles of Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Informed Consent, as well as Assessment of Risks and Benefits. I focused on these principles from the two ethical frameworks because I believed that they were the most relevant to the LLL research study, as well as the Link Lab as its own entity. The other principles were unused in this report.

The  recommendations listed below are designed to improve LLL and help shift the study into greater congruence with the EAD and BR. This will ensure that as Link Lab researchers, we can perform ethical research even at the cutting edge of our respective fields.

**Recommendations**

The following points are recommendations for bringing the Living Link Lab Project more aligned with the EAD and BR.

- Devise a plan to provide participants with information regarding the data being collected and the location the data is being collected from.
  - The Link Lab needs signs on the door informing people that their data are being collected.
  - Pamphlets or a laminated handout available at the side of the entrance for people who greater detail.

- People should have the ability to opt out of having their information collect.

- Design is needed for people to be able to access their own information

- LLL project needs framework/protocol for when someone who legally cannot consent enter the Link Lab.

- The LLL project needs to have a framework in place for users vs. non-users
  - Mechanisms for handling stigma against people who don&#39;t participate.

- Researchers need to outline the steps being taken to deidentify the information, especially as some information can be used as identifiers for mental health issues.

- Framework/Robot rule set needs to be developed to reduce the likelihood that the robot will knock someone&#39;s cane or crutch away from them.

Ethics

1. To be aligned with the EAD, the LL really should have a standardized code of ethics
  1. Why is this? Tolu mentioned it and I feel like it&#39;s true, but why?
2. LL doesn&#39;t define privacy information

1.
  1.
    1. That is definitely required to be in line with the EAD
      1. Especially since simply entering the LL gives consent to have information gathered
  2. Documentation on the privacy and ethics information should be freely available to everyone entering the lab or considering whether they should enter the lab.
  3. Better safety training for equipment in the lab (ie some of the machines should we use a fire extinguisher if they go off and we are working with them?)
  4. Requiring training of researchers aside from the most basic IRB stuff.
  5. if working with medical records shouldn&#39;t they have a crash course in HIPPA?

Research Design

1. Consistency in design and framework to handle multicultural data.
2. How will the LLL project account for differences between people in its data gathering?
  1. The Link Lab is very diverse in terms of culture, ie we have people from many different cultures
    1. Different cultures have different norms, how will that affect behavioral interpretation in LLL
    2. If cultural differences are taken into consideration, how will the LLL data collection differentiate between people to determine whether a behavior falls within culture norms.
    3. This is especially true for facial expressions
  2. The link lab is also different in terms of race, gender, disability, sexual orientation
    1. Will that cause variations in the data being collected?
      1. Almost certainly, so how has that been taken into account/discussed.
      2. How will those differences be identified in the data so it can be accounted for, if applicable.
      3. Does that even need to be accounted for? [goes back to point 1)]
  3. What about the differences in baseline biostats?
    1. Ie people with BD have a different heart rate variability than non-BD people
      1. Obviously you can&#39;t ask people about disabilities
      2. Currently I don&#39;t think HRV is measured, but a good example
    2. Will differences in biostats would affect the data being collected?
      1. Goes back to transparency, what&#39;s being gathered?
      2. Will certain medical conditions cause different levels of a biostat being measured
    3. Can you get a baseline on the different participants to determine changes in biostats being collected
      1. How would you ensure the privacy of such things?
    4. Not just biostats, is vocal data being recorded?

Safety of participants

1. No harm being the best practice currently
2. What is being done to ensure safety and wellbeing of lab residents.
3. What are the benefits that will outweigh the risk of negative impact to residents. (transparency)

Security and Privacy

1.
  1. Physical hacks are the most obvious.
    1. It&#39;s really easy for visitors to get let in.
    2. Ie mitigating potential negative impacts on residents of the lab
    3.
    4. Should we require researchers to take a HIPPA course because of the medical data
    5. Especially if we are also working with the hospital




The Link Lab is on the leading edge of collaborative workspaces in academic research, with the goal of improving the fields of Smart Health, Smart Cities and Autonomous Systems. As with any field leader, the studies performed by Link Lab researchers often involve topics that do not yet have best practice guidelines. In these situations, Link Lab researchers can use the guidelines from Ethically Aligned Design to form an ethical framework for their study.



Ethical research is a core component of the Link Lab. In order to exemplify the pertinent principles outlined in the EAD, Link Lab researchers periodically reexamine their study designs and proposals, and alter them as needed to ensure they are meeting the Link Lab&#39;s high ethical standards. For example, Data Access is a core component of the EAD, and researchers at the Lab are improving their designs to increase participant knowledge regarding what data are being collected, as well as making it easier for participants to access their data. Allowing participants access to their own data also reduces the Risk of Misuse by an AI/S system, since the participant is able to double check its accuracy. Competency is another key component of the Link Lab, no one in the Link Lab is allowed to do research without first having done the appropriate trainings, and demonstrated the knowledge necessary to take part in the research.

Above all other principles, the Link Lab embodies the principle of Human Rights the most. The Link Lab is full of people from many different cultures, part of its strength and success comes directly from its diversity. The culture at the Link Lab is very respectful, inclusive, and supportive, you&#39;ll often see lunch groups where everyone appears to be from different backgrounds. That respect for each other translates into our research as well. Researchers at the Link Lab strive to create studies that respect people&#39;s autonomy, especially their right to informed consent, which is a principle that people should have information about the study before they consent to take part in it. To further that end Link Lab researchers have been working on more fully integrating information regarding the purpose of the study into the study, with the goal of increasing people&#39;s ability to offer informed consent.

The Link Lab has done many amazing things so far, and will continue to do them in the future. Researchers in the lab are hard at work ensuring that their research designs are aligned with the ethical principles outlined in the EAD. By striving to align with the principles of the EAD, we at the Link Lab can ensure that our research follows strong ethical guidelines even at the cutting edge of our respective fields.
