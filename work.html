            Contributitons: 
            1. Developed Python scripts to extract and clean 3,110,400 radar sample data, crawled weather data from websites  and developed scripts to visualize results dynamically 
            2. Built relational (MySQL) to store weather & radar data for consistency and migrated data to NoSQL databases (MongoDB) for better scaling 
            3. Trained different Machine Learning models from different AI Challenge on Meteorology and applied optimal parameter to overcome overfitting, reaching accuracy of 83%.
